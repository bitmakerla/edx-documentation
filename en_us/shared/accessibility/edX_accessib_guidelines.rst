****************************************************************
What Is The edX Accessibility Best Practices Guidance Based On?
****************************************************************

edX measures and evaluates accessibility primarily using the World Wide Web Consortium's
`Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 <https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG/>`_
(05 June 2018). All features that are merged into edX repositories are
expected to `conform <https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/#conformance>`_ to `Level AA
<https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/#cc1>`_ of this specification and satisfy the
requirements outlined in the edX `Website Accessibility Policy
<https://www.edx.org/accessibility>`_.

In addition, our guidance is based on principles of `universal
design <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_design>`_ (usable by all, to the greatest extent possible, without the need for
adaptation or specialized design) and `Universal Design for Learning (UDL) <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Design_for_Learning>`_. Course teams who build courses based on
these principles create an inclusive experience that considers the diverse set
of learning styles and needs of all learners, including learners with
disabilities, learners whose native language is not English, and learners with
technical issues such as low bandwidth internet or no access to audio.

For the purposes of this guidance, we assume that course content creators are equipped with
the appropriate adaptive technology and compatible software, for testing and validation. To supplement the
accessibility of the materials you can create within our platform, we recommend that
you engage the resources available at your institution to support learners
with disabilities. Most institutions offer disability support services and
information technology resources that provide accessibility advice and
support. These professionals are trained in making disability accommodation
decisions and can advise you on what accommodations may be appropriate in
light of the goals of the course and the instructional methodologies employed. They can also help with `document accessibility remediation <https://helpx.adobe.com/acrobat/using/create-verify-pdf-accessibility.html>`_ and sourcing providers for learners' `real-time captioning <https://www.nad.org/resources/technology/captioning-for-access/communication-access-realtime-translation/>`_, `signed-language interpretation <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_interpretation#Sign_language>`_, or `cued speech transliteration <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cued_speech>`_ needs.
